The AI engineer's work primarily involved building the TextGrow application, starting from an initial codebase structure and evolving it based on user requirements. Key decisions included migrating from MongoDB to Supabase for the backend, implementing a full React frontend dashboard, and developing a Chrome extension for inline text expansion. A significant portion of the trajectory focused on debugging Supabase integration issues, specifically schema access and permissions, followed by ironing out authentication flow discrepancies between the web app and the Chrome extension. The engineer systematically addressed errors, particularly those related to database connectivity, schema resolution, and JWT-based authentication, iterating through various fixes until core functionalities were validated. The work concluded with the engineer in the process of implementing a robust authentication bridge for the Chrome extension.

<product_requirements>
The user requires a full-stack TextGrow application for managing and expanding text shortcuts. The application consists of a web dashboard and a Chrome extension.
Initially, the application was intended to use a FastAPI backend, React frontend, and MongoDB database. However, the user explicitly requested a change to **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** for the backend, stating that all necessary tables were already set up within a  schema. The user also requested **OAuth authentication** configuration, specifically Google, later explicitly rejecting GitHub.
Core features for the web dashboard include:
*   **Shortcut Management**: Create, read, update, delete, and search text shortcuts.
*   **Folder Organization**: Manage shortcuts within folders.
*   **Tag System**: Categorize shortcuts using tags.
*   **Export/Import**: Functionality for data backup and restoration.
*   **Authentication**: Secure user login, initially with mock auth, then transitioned to Supabase's real authentication.
The **Chrome Extension** is critical for inline text expansion functionality across web pages. It needs to sync with the backend for user shortcuts and maintain authentication.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React**: Frontend framework for building the web dashboard.
-   **FastAPI**: Python framework for the backend API.
-   **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-Service providing PostgreSQL database, authentication, and REST APIs.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the frontend.
-   **Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)**: For browser integration and inline text expansion.
-   **OAuth**: Google OAuth for user authentication through Supabase.
-   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure authentication between frontend, backend, and extension.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a monorepo-like structure, with distinct directories for backend, frontend, and the Chrome extension.

-   Full OAuth configuration for Google (backend integration of actual Google credentials).
-   PWA features: offline-first caching, installable on mobile, push notifications.
-   Refine Chrome extension text expansion functionality with backend data.
-   Implement simplified shortcut retrieval in backend (already simplified, but could be enhanced later).
-   Implement Android version (explicitly deferred by user).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on bridging the authentication state between the main web dashboard and the Chrome extension. The primary challenge identified was that the Chrome extension was not inheriting the login status from the web application, despite the web app successfully logging in via Supabase/Google OAuth.

The current approach to resolve this is to implement a **token copy/paste mechanism**. This involves:
1.  **Web Dashboard ():** Modifying the main React application to provide the user's Supabase session token (JWT). This token can then be manually copied by the user. A  function was added, and its invocation site was also modified.
2.  **Chrome Extension ( and ):** Updating the extension's popup UI to include an input field where the user can paste this token. The  file is being updated to handle receiving this token and using it to authenticate API calls from the extension to the backend.

The last action recorded was the modification of  to handle the token pasting functionality. This is a crucial step towards making the Chrome extension fully functional with the user's actual authenticated data.
